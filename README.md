# Classification-Model-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project implements a classification model using Logistic Regression to predict target values based on input features. The dataset is preprocessed using techniques such as feature scaling, and the model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
