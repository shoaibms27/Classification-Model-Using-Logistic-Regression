#Classification Model Using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates a classification model using Logistic Regression to predict target values from a given dataset. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with clear visualization of the results.

Features
Train-test split for unbiased evaluation.
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Logistic Regression for classification.
Model evaluation using:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Accuracy Score
Visualization of true vs. predicted values.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn

Dataset
The dataset (logit classification.csv) contains:

Input features (columns 2 and 3 in the dataset).
Target variable for classification.
Results
Confusion Matrix: Displays true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative values.
Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Accuracy Score: Represents overall model performance.
Visualization: Graph comparing true vs. predicted values.
Future Enhancements
Use advanced algorithms like Random Forest or SVM.
Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.
Experiment with different datasets for scalability.
